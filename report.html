                    <li>
                        <strong>If both are too complicated:</strong> Hire Hire Matthew to complete it for you (He can do it from his house and would charge $200 to add the translation feature to every page for you). It's worth it to reach more people with your ministry!

                <h3>Q: Will this cost money every month?</h3>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> No! The Google Translate widget (Option 1) is completely free forever. No monthly fees, no credit card needed.</p>

                <h3>Q: Do I need to know how to code?</h3>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> No, but you'll need someone who can help you copy and paste code in the right spot. (or at least show you for the first couple of times you use it)</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q: Will it work with my CoffeeCup website?</h3>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> Yes! The Google Translate widget works with any HTML website, including ones made with CoffeeCup.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q: How do I know it's working?</h3>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> After you add it, visit your website and look for a dropdown menu that says "Select Language." Click it and choose Spanish - your page should translate to Spanish!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q: What if I mess up my website?</h3>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> Matthew made a backup of your website on his home computer this morning.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q: Will this help people find me on Google in their language?</h3>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> Not with the free version. For that, you'd need a paid service like Weglot (~$15/month). But the free version is still MUCH better than what you have now!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q: Do I have to add it to every page?</h3>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, but once it's done, it's done forever. Many CoffeeCup users have templates - if you use a template, you might only need to update the template once!</p>
